Documentation for the NBG Tuning website:

Since the website primarily caters to French-speaking users, there isn't a translated version available.

Please note that the "À propos," "Galerie," and "Contact" pages are not functional. Attempting to access them will result in an error page.

You are welcome to create an account on the "Inscription" page and log in via the "Connexion" page. However, the "Mot de passe oublié" feature, 
which allows you to recover your password, is inactive due to the absence of an email server.

For access to an admin account, please use the following credentials:

Email: test@gmail.com
Password: testtest

The user interface on the "Mon compte" page was accessible previously but is currently inaccessible. However, it allowed users to manage their accounts and view purchase history.

The admin account provides similar functionalities, with the addition of being able to view purchase histories of all users.

When logged in as an admin, you can create new articles under "Nouveau produit." You have the option to either create a new category or use an existing one, 
provide article details, and upload multiple images.

After submission, you'll be redirected to the article page, and all articles can be viewed on the "Boutique" page. 
Adding an item to your cart will redirect you to the cart page. Payment processing is handled by the Stripe API. 
For testing purposes, you can use the following credit card information: 4242 4242 4242 4242, along with random details.

Upon successful payment, you'll be redirected to the confirmation page. Feel free to generate an invoice by clicking on "Facture."

Please note that the appearance of the website is just a demo, as the CEO of NBG Tuning did not provide a design to replicate.

That concludes the documentation. Thank you for reading.
